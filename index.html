    <p>Today, I visited the British Museum official website and experience its online exhibition function.
    <p>Although, it is not my first experience to enjoy collection and exhibition online, the British Museum still makes me satisfied with various collection from different countries which show a wide range of themes from culture to environment.For example, the The Citi exhibition, called 'Arctic: culture and climate', really shows what happens in the Arctic and how it is affecting people.
    <p>I think it is pretty important to have more online visit to museums or galleries in this severe situation to get more spiritual comfort and learn from it.
